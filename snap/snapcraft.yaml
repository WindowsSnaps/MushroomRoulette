description: |
  Use the mouse/touchscreen to click places for the player to move to or use
  your keyboard arrow keys.

  If using a touch screen it is reccomended you drag your path for the play
  to move along.

  Escape (Esc) takes you back to the menu.

  * Quick Play Info *
  Red Mushroom - Gives you 50 Score and 10 Health.
  Pink Mushroom - Gives you 150 Score takes 40 Health.
  Grey Mushroom - Makes all movable boxes unmovable.
  Purple Mushroom - Allows you to destroy one box.
  Butterfly - Takes a sixth of your Score and a third of your health.

  The general idea is to get the highest score at the lowest level.
  Otherwise the most efficient score.

  * Hats *
  There are six hats and each hat gives you a temporary score
  bonus. If you are hit by a butterfly while wearing a hat,
  it protects your score,however, you lose your current hat
  and the hat's temporary score bonus but nothing else. If
  you are wearing a hat and pickup another hat, the score
  bonus from the first hat will become permanent and you will
  only lose the score of the new hat when a butterfly hits you.

  * Well *
  This is the well. It holds magical powers and if you jump 
  into one of these you will be transported to one of three
  mini-games. All mini games give you the chance to boost 
  your score, so when one appears in your main game you 
  better jump down it quick as it wont be around for long!

  * Red Mushroom *
  This is simply the Red Mushroom, the red mushroom likes the
  man and only exists to be eaten by the man, if you eat this
  guy you get 50 score points and 10 health points.

  * Pink Mushroom *
  This is Pinkey the pick pocket, you eat one of these you will
  get 150 score points, however they don't hand over the good
  stuff without a fight and they will drain 40 health points.

  * Black Mushroom *
  This is Coal the cube cripple, if you eat this guy all of the
  moveable game cubes will be crippled and no longer will you be
  able to just push them around!

  * Purple Mushroom *
  This is Brinjal the block buster, if you eat brinjal you will
  obtain his magical powers of destruction and the next cube
  (or butterfly) you walk into will be destroyed.

  * Butterfly *
  This is the Butterfly, there's more than one of them and they
  hate the man, they hate the man so much that if you run into
  one of these mean machines it will attack you and take a third
  of your health and a sixth of your score points.

  * Man *
  This is "the man", essentially he is you, or you have a good
  deal of control over him. He is known for his dark square shades,
  his appetite for wild mushrooms and naturalist look. After level
  200 "the man" evolves into "the wise man".
